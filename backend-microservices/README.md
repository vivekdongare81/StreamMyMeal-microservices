# Fintech-Event-Driven-Microservices

This project is a **microservices-based fintech platform** built using an **event-driven architecture**. It simulates a banking/financial ecosystem where independent services communicate asynchronously through messaging. The architecture is designed for **scalability**, **resilience**, and **modularity**, making it ideal for modern financial applications.
