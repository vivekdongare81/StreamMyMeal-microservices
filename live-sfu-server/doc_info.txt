Here's how the frontend app creates broadcasts and viewers for live streaming, specifically for the /broadcaster and /viewer routes:
1. Frontend Routing and Entry Points
The frontend uses React Router to map /broadcaster to the Broadcaster component and /viewer to the Viewer component (frontend-app/src/App.tsx).
There are also links/buttons in the UI (e.g., on the home page) that direct users to these routes.

2. Broadcast Creation (/broadcaster)
File: frontend-app/src/pages/Broadcaster.tsx
How it works:
When a user visits /broadcaster, the app:
Connects to the SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) server via Socket.IO (http://localhost:4000).
Requests RTP capabilities from the SFU.
Loads the Mediasoup device with these capabilities.
Requests access to the user's camera and microphone.
Creates a WebRTC send transport via the SFU.
Produces (publishes) the user's video and audio tracks to the SFU.
Sets the local video preview.
Listens for new viewers joining (via the new-consumer event).
Result: The broadcaster's media is sent to the SFU, making it available for viewers.
3. Viewer Creation (/viewer)
File: frontend-app/src/pages/Viewer.tsx
How it works:
When a user visits /viewer, the app:
Connects to the SFU via Socket.IO.
Requests RTP capabilities and loads the Mediasoup device.
Creates a WebRTC receive transport.
Listens for new-producer events (i.e., when a broadcaster is live).
When a producer (broadcaster) is available, it requests to consume the video.
Receives the video track and attaches it to the video element for playback.
Result: The viewer receives and watches the live stream from the broadcaster.

4. How the Flow is Triggered
Navigation: Users can click "Go Live (Broadcaster)" or "Watch Live (Viewer)" on the home page (frontend-app/src/pages/Index.tsx), which navigates to the respective routes.
Live Streaming Page: There is also a /live/:restaurantId route for watching specific restaurant streams, but /broadcaster and /viewer are the generic entry points for starting and watching a broadcast.
5. Backend/Signaling
The actual signaling and media routing is handled by the SFU server (live-sfu-server/server.js), which manages transports, producers, and consumers for each peer (broadcaster/viewer).
The backend service (live-streaming-service) can also start/stop sessions and interact with the SFU, but the direct media flow is between the frontend and the SFU.
Summary Table
| Route | Component | What it does |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /broadcaster | Broadcaster.tsx| Publishes local video/audio to SFU, starts a broadcast |
| /viewer | Viewer.tsx | Connects to SFU, consumes and plays broadcast media from a broadcaster |
| /live/:id | LiveStreaming | (For restaurant-specific streams, may use mock data or similar logic) |

Excellent question! Here’s a clear, honest answer:

---

## **Do You Need to Run 2 Backends and 1 Frontend for Mediasoup?**

**Yes, if you use mediasoup (or any SFU), you will need:**
- **1. The SFU server** (e.g., mediasoup, which is Node.js-based)
- **2. Your Spring Boot backend** (for business logic, authentication, restaurant info, etc.)
- **3. Your React frontend** (for the user interface)

**So you would run:**
- `mediasoup-server` (Node.js, handles all video/audio)
- `spring-boot-backend` (Java, handles your app logic)
- `frontend-app` (React, user interface)

---

## **Why?**

- **Spring Boot** is great for business logic, REST APIs, and signaling (text/data).
- **WebRTC SFUs** (like mediasoup) are specialized for real-time media routing and are not available as Java libraries. They are written in Node.js, C, or Go for performance and ecosystem reasons.
- **React frontend** connects to both for signaling and media.

---

## **Can You Do Everything With Just Spring Boot?**

**No, not for scalable WebRTC media.**
- There is **no mature, production-ready Java SFU** for WebRTC.
- Java can do signaling, but not efficient media routing for many viewers.
- All real-world scalable WebRTC solutions use a dedicated media server (SFU) written in Node.js, C, or Go.

---

## **What If You Want Only Spring Boot?**

- You can keep your current mesh approach (1:1 connections), but it will not scale beyond a few viewers.
- You can use Spring Boot for signaling and business logic, but you still need a media server for scalable video.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Approach                | Scalable? | Only Spring Boot? | Production Ready? |
|-------------------------|:---------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Mesh (current)          |    ❌     |       ✔️         |        ❌         |
| Spring Boot + SFU (Node/C/Go) |    ✔️     |       ❌         |        ✔️         |
| YouTube/Twitch Embed    |    ✔️     |       ✔️         |        ✔️         |

---

## **What Should You Do?**

- **For a real, scalable live streaming site:**  
  Use a dedicated SFU (like mediasoup) for media, and keep Spring Boot for your app logic.
- **For a small demo or private use:**  
  You can stick with Spring Boot only, but you will be limited to a few viewers.

---

## **Bottom Line**

- **You cannot build a scalable, production-grade WebRTC SFU in Java/Spring Boot alone.**
- All scalable solutions use a dedicated media server (SFU) in addition to your main backend.

---

**If you want to proceed with a scalable solution, you will need to run both a Node.js SFU and your Spring Boot backend.  
If you want to stick with Spring Boot only, you must accept the mesh limitations.**

**SFU** stands for **Selective Forwarding Unit**.

---

### **What is an SFU?**

- An **SFU** is a type of media server used in WebRTC (real-time video/audio streaming).
- It **receives media streams** (audio/video) from one or more senders (like a broadcaster).
- It **forwards those streams** to multiple receivers (viewers), but does **not mix** them.
- Each viewer gets a copy of the original stream(s), possibly with some selection/filtering.

---

### **Why is it called “Selective Forwarding”?**

- The SFU can **selectively forward** only the streams that each participant needs.
- For example, in a group call, you might only receive video from the people you’re watching.

---

### **How is it different from an MCU?**

- **MCU** = **Multipoint Control Unit** (mixes all streams into one, higher CPU usage).
- **SFU** = **Selective Forwarding Unit** (forwards streams as-is, more efficient for many viewers).

---

| SFU     | Selective Forwarding Unit| Forwards streams to viewers |
| MCU     | Multipoint Control Unit  | Mixes streams into one      |

**In short:**  
An **SFU** is a media server that makes scalable live streaming and group video calls possible by efficiently forwarding streams to many users.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**You CAN create live streaming in Java with 1 broadcaster and multiple viewers, but only for very small audiences (2–5 viewers) using the mesh approach.**  
However, for **scalable, production-grade live streaming** (1 broadcaster, many viewers, like YouTube Live or Zoom), **Java alone is not enough**—you need a dedicated media server (SFU), and all mature SFUs are written in Node.js, C, or Go, not Java.

---

## **What’s Possible With Java/Spring Boot Only?**

- **Mesh Topology (Peer-to-Peer):**
  - 1 broadcaster, each viewer connects directly to the broadcaster.
  - Works for 1–5 viewers.
  - Broadcaster’s CPU and bandwidth usage increases with each viewer.
  - Not scalable for real-world use.

- **No Java SFU:**  
  - There is **no mature, open-source SFU written in Java** for WebRTC.
  - Java can do signaling, business logic, and REST APIs, but not efficient media routing for many viewers.

---

## **Why Not?**

- **WebRTC media routing (SFU) is complex and performance-critical.**
- The open-source community and industry have standardized on Node.js (mediasoup), C (Janus), or Go (Pion) for SFUs.
- Java is not used for this because of performance, ecosystem, and lack of libraries.

---

## **What If You Really Want Java-Only?**

- You can only do mesh (1:1, 1:2, maybe 1:3) with Spring Boot as the signaling server.
- For more viewers, the broadcaster’s browser will lag, freeze, or crash.

---

## **What About Commercial Java Solutions?**

- Some commercial video platforms (e.g., Wowza) may have Java APIs, but they are not open-source and are not pure Java SFUs.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Approach         | Java Only? | Scalable? | Real-World Use? |
|------------------|:----------:|:---------:|:---------------:|
| Mesh (P2P)       |    ✔️      |    ❌     |      ❌         |
| Java SFU         |    ❌      |    ✔️     |      ❌         |
| Node/C/Go SFU    |    ❌      |    ✔️     |      ✔️         |

---

## **Bottom Line**

- **For a few viewers:** Java-only (mesh) is fine.
- **For many viewers:** You need a dedicated SFU (not available in Java).

---

**If you want to build a scalable, production-ready live streaming platform, you will need to use a Node.js/C/Go SFU alongside your Java backend.**

If you want to stick with Java-only for a small demo, you can—but it will not scale.

**Let me know if you want to see how to set up a real SFU, or if you want to keep your current mesh approach!**
